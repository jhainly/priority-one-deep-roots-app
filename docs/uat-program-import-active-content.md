# UAT: Program Import and Active Content Loading

## Test Case ID

UAT-IMPORT-001

## Purpose

Verify that an admin can import a YAML program, preview it, publish it to a selected group, and that members of that same group can load the published active program on the dashboard and day journal screens.

## Scope

This test covers:

- Admin YAML import preview.
- Program publish to a selected group.
- Group active program pointer update.
- Member dashboard loading from the persisted active program snapshot.
- Member day view loading from the persisted active program snapshot.

This test does not cover:

- Journal encryption save/load.
- PDF export.
- Leaderboard scoring accuracy.

## Preconditions

- The app is deployed or running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Amplify sandbox or AWS backend is running and `amplify_outputs.json` points to that backend.
- Tester has one Cognito account in the `ADMINS` or `LEADERS` group.
- Tester has access to `/admin/programs/import`.
- At least one group exists.
- The admin account is a member or leader of the group being tested.
- The browser session is signed in as the admin user.

## Test Data

Use a valid one-week YAML program with:

- `program.id`
- `program.title`
- `program.version`
- `weeks`
- 1 week
- 7 days
- sections with unique prompt IDs
- embedded scripture text
- point values

Record these values before testing:

- Test group name:
- Test group ID, if visible:
- Expected program title:
- Expected week title:
- Expected day 1 title:

## Steps and Expected Results

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Sign in as an admin or leader. | User is authenticated and top navigation shows admin access. |
| 2 | Open `/admin/programs/import`. | Import page loads with YAML source panel and preview panel. |
| 3 | Paste the test YAML into the Program content field. | YAML remains editable and no validation result is shown yet. |
| 4 | Click `Preview program`. | Preview panel renders the program title, week/day counts, week selector, day selector, and rendered sections. |
| 5 | Confirm the selected group is the intended test group. | Group selector displays the intended group. |
| 6 | Click `Publish weeks`. | Page displays a successful publish message. |
| 7 | If an error appears, copy the exact error text. | Test fails. Record the error under Actual Result. |
| 8 | Open `/dashboard`. | Dashboard loads without server error. |
| 9 | If more than one group exists, select the same group used during publish. | Dashboard switches to the selected group. |
| 10 | Review the program section of the dashboard. | Dashboard shows the imported program title, selected week title, week summary, days, and available points from the persisted snapshot. |
| 11 | Open day 1 from the dashboard. | Day journal page opens for the imported program's day 1 content. |
| 12 | Compare day title, sections, scripture, prompts, and point values to the imported YAML. | Day journal content matches the imported YAML exactly. |

## Pass Criteria

The test passes only if:

- Preview renders successfully.
- Publish returns `Program published.`
- Dashboard loads the selected group's active program from the persisted snapshot.
- Day journal loads the same persisted program content.
- No sample program content appears unless that exact sample content was imported and published.

## Fail Criteria

The test fails if:

- Publish returns an error.
- Dashboard says no active program was published after a successful publish.
- Dashboard shows sample content instead of imported content.
- Day journal 404s for a valid imported week/day.
- Day journal content does not match the imported YAML.
